# Wrong logic

- [ ] Cannot castle even if not check (long castle)


# Upgrades

- [ ] Welcome screen
- [ ] End screen with score
- [ ] Promotion panel
- [ ] Settings panel
- [ ] Imports must be checked on venv and other paths


# Ideas

- [ ] Checkbox for showing possible moves
- [ ] Undo move
- [ ] Threefold repetition (is it needed?)
- [ ] Coloring last move
- [ ] Rotating board
- [ ] Counting material
- [ ] Print after every move (sys.stdout flush?)
